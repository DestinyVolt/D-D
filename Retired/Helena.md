### Backstory
Background: Noble \
Feature: Position of Privilege \
Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.

Personality Trait: I like getting into fights, but I feel bad if the other person doesn't deserve it \
Personality Trait: The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it. \
Ideal: Independence. I can handle myself without any of coddling or barriers from my family. \
Bond: (Hopefully something related to the local Brockhollows) \
Flaw: By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my family. 

Backstory (Brief): \
Helena is a student at a boarding school in London. Her parents sent her there because she's generally a nuisance and a delinquent, and hoped that this would shape her up. While the school is incredibly strict, it hasn't helped much. She developed a habit of climbing out the window of her 3rd story dorm (and helping other girls do the same), so they could all mess about the town during the night. She was known to commit acts of vandalism and non-violent crimes during this, rationalizing that nobody would be willing to accuse her so long as she wasn't caught in the act, and was generally a bad influence on those around her. Her family is somehow related to the Brockhollows, and her father sent her a message requesting that she purchase and send a gift to the Squire for his birthday. She managed to deceive the headmaster into believing she was to deliver this in person, and basically invites herself to the Brockhollows' party.
