Mrs. Penumbra's Tea House is hidden away in a poorer part of town. It looks drab from the outside, but walking inside reveals it to be a clean, quaint little place, with many books to read, mysterious ambient music flowing from self winding music boxes, a few ornate  hand-crafted coocoo clocks, and a variety of rare teas. Upon entering, a short, elderly woman wearing a large shawl will stand, supporting herself with a cane, adjust her glasses and then take a good look at you, offering you a drink. To most, she is simply polite and quiet, but to a very select few, those who she determines are of a special sort, she strikes up conversation, potentially revealing the tiefling horns she keeps hidden under a hat, and letting them know that should they ever need it, this is a safe place to hide, where they need not conceal who they are, leading them to a hidden room in the shop. She seems to know whenever anyone enters the shop, and if anyone threatens violence, she will reach behind her back, pulling a shotgun from seemingly nowhere, and politely request that the offender stop trespassing and leave so things don't have to get messy.
