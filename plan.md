## The Plan
### Sneaking in 
Vomi, Arcana, and Ave are the only ones who are officially at the party (I don't know about Andrius). \
Sarsariph and Ligh are hidden within the bags of holding. \
Once inside, the three of us sneak off to a place that can't be seen to meet up with Andrius. \
Ave and Arcana disguise ourselves as Path members. \
Ligh and Sarsariph get out of the bags. \
Sarsariph casts Pass without a Trace. \
Ligh, Andrius and Sarsariph are turned invisible by Ave. \
Vomi gets into a Bag of Holding. \
We go through the door. Andrius picks the lock to the side room and we all hide inside \
Andrius picks the lock to the office. 

### Assassination
Vomi drinks a Disguise Self potion from Arcana to look like the path member Arcana looked like, while Arcana disguises herself as the 3rd in command. \
Vomi, Arcana, and Ave bust in and quickly kill the two head path members, using only Slashing, Force, Psychic, and Radient damage. \
Arcana mimics the head priest and calls in the third in command, and he is killed as well. 

### The Coverup
Ave cleans up the crime scene and the party loots it. \
Ligh picks up head priest corpse (turning it invisible). \
Ave puts the second in command priest in their Bag of Holding. \
Sarsariph puts the third in command's body in his Bag of Holding OR Arcana puts it in the Portable Hole. \
Vomi, Ave, and Ligh leave and exit the basement. \
Vomi slips back into the crowd. 

### The Heist
Arcana, Andrius, and Sarsariph head to the alchemy area. \
Arcana pops Petro into the vault to scout it. \
The three of them head to the potions, Andrius picking locks along the way if need be, where Arcana takes them using the 3rd in commands authority. \
Arcana teleports in and out of the vault to loot it if she had the scrolls / spell slots, with Sarsariph keeping guard. \
Arcana, Andrius, and Sarsariph get out of the basement. \
Sarsariph and Andrius exit the building, still invisible. \
Arcana slips back into the crowd. 

### The Big Reveal
Ave and Ligh go to a high point to do the big reveal. \
Ave disguises themself as the 3rd in command. \
Ave calls everyone's attention, dropping the two bodies, condemning the men, and then seemingly disappearring. \
Ave actually uses the scroll of minor illusion to play the message using his voice, Ligh throws the guys over the edge, and then Ave Dimension Doors both of them out of the Church. 

## Materials Needed
Andrius needs to get us, at the very minimum: \
1 Bag of Holding 

Ability to take something from the vault: \
1 Additional Bag of Holding 

Ability to truly raid the vault: \
1 Portable Hole instead of 1 Bag of Holding

Increase chance to raid the vault: \
1 Misty Step Spell Scroll or 250 gold & 3 days

Ensure we raid the vault: \
1 Catnap Spell Scroll OR \
2x Misty Step Scroll OR MAYBE (250 Gold worth of ink) x2 & 3 Days and you SERIOUSLY OWE ME)
