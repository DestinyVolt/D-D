Start: Sneaking in \
Needed from Andrius: 1 bag of holding or (preferably) a Portable Hole \
Vomi, Arcana, and Ave are the only ones who are officially at the party (I don't know about Andrius). \
Sarsariph and Ligh are hidden within the bags of holding. \
Once inside, the three of us sneak off to a place that can't be seen to meet up with Andrius, where Ave and I disguise ourselves as Path members. Ligh and Sarsariph get out of the bags. Sarsariph casts Pass without a Trace, and then both of them, along with Andrius, are turned invisible by Ave, while Vomi gets into a Bag of Holding. \
We sneak into the basement, and all hide away in the room adjacent to the office. \
Andrius picks the lock. \
Vomi drinks a Disguise Self potion from Arcana to look like the path member Arcana looked like, while Arcana disguises herself as the 3rd in command. \
Vomi, Arcana, and Ave bust in and quickly kill the two head path members, using only Slashing, Force, and Radient damage. \
Arcana mimics the head priest and calls in the third in command, and he is killed as well.\
Note: If we could get a Catnap scroll that would be awesome, otherwise Arcana will not be able to break into the vault unless she conserves all her spell slots. \
Ligh picks up head priest corpse (turning it invisible). Other priest goes in the Bag of Holding. 
Ave cleans up the crime scene and the party loots it.
Arcana, Andrius, and Sarsariph head to the alchemy area.
Arcana pops Petro into the vault to scout it. 
The three of them head to the potions, Andrius picking locks along the way if need be, where Arcana takes them using the 3rd in commands authority.
Arcana teleports in and out of the vault to loot it if she had the scrolls / spell slots, with Sarsariph keeping guard. 
Vomi, Ave, and Ligh leave and exit the basement. 
Vomi slips back into the crowd. 
Ave and Ligh go to a high point to do the big reveal. 
Arcana, Andrius, and Sarsariph get out of the basement.
Sarsariph and Andrius exit the building, still invisible. 
Arcana slips back into the crowd.
Ave disguises themself as the 3rd in command. 
Ave calls everyone's attention, dropping the two bodies, condemning the men, and then seemingly disappearring. 
Ave actually uses the Magic Mouth to play a pre-recorded message, Ligh throws the guys over the edge, and then Ave steps back into the Bag of Holding.
Ligh picks up the bag of holding and climbs across the ceiling, escaping. He finds a place to drop Ave off and then exits the building in the chaos.
Arcana, Ave, and Vomi make sure that things go as hoped and then exit.
