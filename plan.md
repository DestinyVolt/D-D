Start: Sneaking in \
Needed from Andrius: 1 bag of holding or (preferably) a Portable Hole \
Vomi, Arcana, and Ave are the only ones who are officially at the party (I don't know about Andrius). \
Sarsariph and Ligh are hidden within the bags of holding. \
Once inside, the three of us sneak off to a place that can't be seen to meet up with Andrius, where Ave and I disguise ourselves as Path members. Ligh and Sarsariph get out of the bags. Sarsariph casts Pass without a Trace, and then both of them, along with Andrius, are turned invisible by Ave, while Vomi gets into a Bag of Holding. \
We sneak into the basement, and all hide away in the room adjacent to the office. \
Andrius picks the lock. \
Vomi drinks a Disguise Self potion from Arcana to look like the path member Arcana looked like, while Arcana disguises herself as the 3rd in command. \
Vomi, Arcana, and Ave bust in and quickly kill the two head path members, using only Slashing, Force, and Radient damage. \
Arcana mimics the head priest and calls in the third in command, and he is killed as well.\
Note: If we could get a Catnap scroll that would be awesome, otherwise Arcana will not be able to break into the vault unless she conserves all her spell slots. \
Ligh picks up head priest corpse (turning it invisible). Other priest goes in the Bag of Holding.
