## The Plan
### Sneaking in 
Vomi, Arcana, and Ave are the only ones who are officially at the party (I don't know about Andrius). \
Sarsariph and Ligh are hidden within the bags of holding. \
Once inside, the three of us sneak off to a place that can't be seen to meet up with Andrius. \
Ave and Arcana disguise ourselves as Path members. \
Ligh and Sarsariph get out of the bags. \
Sarsariph casts Pass without a Trace. \
Ligh, Andrius and Sarsariph are turned invisible by Ave. \
Vomi gets into a Bag of Holding. \
We go through the door. Andrius picks the lock to the side room and we all hide inside \
Andrius picks the lock to the office. 

### Assassination
Vomi drinks a Disguise Self potion from Arcana to look like the path member Arcana looked like, while Arcana disguises herself as the 3rd in command. \
Vomi, Arcana, and Ave bust in and quickly kill the two head path members, using only Slashing, Force, Psychic, and Radient damage. \
Arcana mimics the head priest and calls in the third in command, and he is killed as well. 

### The Coverup
Ave cleans up the crime scene and the party loots it. \
Ligh picks up head priest corpse (turning it invisible). \
Ave puts the second in command priest in their Bag of Holding. \
Sarsariph puts the third in command's body in his Bag of Holding OR Arcana puts it in the Portable Hole. \
Vomi, Ave, and Ligh leave and exit the basement. \
Vomi slips back into the crowd. 

### The Heist
Arcana, Andrius, and Sarsariph head to the alchemy area. \
Arcana pops Petro into the vault to scout it. \
The three of them head to the potions, Andrius picking locks along the way if need be, where Arcana takes them using the 3rd in commands authority. \
Arcana teleports in and out of the vault to loot it if she had the scrolls / spell slots, with Sarsariph keeping guard. \
Arcana, Andrius, and Sarsariph get out of the basement. \
Sarsariph and Andrius exit the building, still invisible. \
Arcana slips back into the crowd. 

### The Big Reveal
Ave and Ligh go to a high point to do the big reveal. \
Ave disguises themself as the 3rd in command. \
Ave calls everyone's attention, dropping the two bodies, condemning the men, and then seemingly disappearring. \
Ave actually uses the Magic Mouth to play a pre-recorded message, Ligh throws the guys over the edge, and then Ave steps back into the Bag of Holding. \
Ligh picks up the Bag of Holding and climbs across the ceiling, escaping. \
Ligh finds a place to drop Ave off and then exits the building in the chaos. \
Ave slips back into the crowd
