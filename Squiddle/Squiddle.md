**Arcane Recovery:** \\
You can recover half your Wizard Level's worth of Spell Slot levels on a short rest once per day. 

**Wizard 2:** \
Subclass: Chronurgy \

**Chronal Shift:**
At 2nd level, you can magically exert limited control over the flow of time around a creature. As a reaction, after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can force the creature to reroll. You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll. You can use this ability twice, and you regain any expended use when you finish a long rest.

**Temporal Awareness** \
Starting at 2nd level, you can add your Intelligence modifiers to your initiative rolls.

### Racial Abilities
**Illithid Nature:**
You qualify as an Abberation instead of a Humanoid. 

**Mounted Combatant:**
While you are mounted and aren't incapacitated, you gain the following benefits: \
• You have advantage on melee attack rolls against unmounted creatures that are smaller than your mount. \
• You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead. \
• If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity save to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds and half damage if it fails.

**Illithid Bite:**
While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with your bite. When you use your bite and hit a creature that isn’t a Construct or an Undead, you can either regain hit points equal to the damage dealt by the bite or gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make equal to the damage dealt by the bite. You can empower yourself with your bite a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Spider Climb:** You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, at 3rd level, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

#### Background Feature: Faceless
Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self. By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona. This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage. However, should someone realize the connection between your persona and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness. To don your persona, you must cast a ritual spell, which hides your Illithid form for 24 hours. 

### Personality

My responsibility as a train conductor comes first! I have to make sure all my passengers are comfortable, and that nothing stands in the way of the train. \
Helping people makes me happy :) \
I love life, and want to live it to the fullest, even if I'm ashamed of what I am. \
I don't really like lying, but I will if it means helping a friend or hiding my curse. \
(Bond) My clan of gnomes help run the Underdark Railway. I'm friends with most of them, and they know my true nature. \
(Bond) I was taken by mindflayers and turned into this form. I hate all illithid. \
(Flaw) I'm very easily peer pressured into things. \
(Flaw) I'm overly nice to people who are rude to me, so long as they don't get violent. \

Cantrip Formulas (Optional): 
At 3rd level, you have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind. Whenever you finish a long rest and consult those formulas in your spellbook, you can replace one wizard cantrip you know with another cantrip from the wizard spell list. \
