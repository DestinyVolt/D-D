**Arcane Recovery:** \
You can recover half your Wizard Level (rounded up)'s worth of Spell Slot levels on a short rest once per day. 

**Temporal Awareness** \
Starting at 2nd level, you can add your Intelligence modifiers to your initiative rolls.

**Chronal Shift:**
At 2nd level, you can magically exert limited control over the flow of time around a creature. As a reaction, after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can force the creature to reroll. You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll. You can use this ability twice, and you regain any expended use when you finish a long rest.

**Cantrip Formulas:** 
You have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind. Whenever you finish a long rest and consult those formulas in your spellbook, you can replace one wizard cantrip you know with another cantrip from the wizard spell list. 

### Racial Abilities
#### Background Feature: Faceless
Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self. By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona. This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage. However, should someone realize the connection between your persona and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness. To don your persona, you must cast a ritual spell, which hides your Illithid form for 24 hours.
