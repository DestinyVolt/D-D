### Rule Quirks
The goal of this document is to just mention a few of the ways that Aggy's unique circumstances affect various spells and rules. 

### Revival
Aggy Locamote is not truly "the Aggy Locamote" from a cosmic perspective. That Aggy Locamote died when a mindflayer tadpole ate her brain, and her soul moved onto the afterlife. The Aggy Locamote I'm playing is not aware of this and truly believes that she is the one and only Aggy. Because of this (and the fact that she's not Humanoid), some revival spells work oddly. 
Here are the possible cases when a ressurection spell is used: 
- Case (A): Aggy is revived as you would normally expect of a DND Character.
- Case (B): This case only occurs for spells that can create a new body for the target. A new *Gnome* body is created, and the original Aggy Locamote's soul would be put in it. She would have no memory of anything that occured after the tadpole ate her brain. 
- Case (C): If Aggy dies while an Elder Brain is Psychically linked to her, the Elder Brain will consume her essence when she dies, meaning nothing short of a Wish spell can cause Case (A) to occur. Note: This can be countered by Cildri's 9th level ability, *Tokens of the Departed,* if it is used immediately. 


And here are all the revival spells, alongside what happens if they are used on Aggy. 
- Revifify, Raise Dead, Resurrection, and Clone work normally. 
- Reincarnate won't work at all. This is the only one Aggy would be aware of. Note: If, for some reason, we time-travelled back to within 10 days after the train crashed, Reincarnate causes Case (B) to occur. 
- True Resurrection works normally if there is any part of Aggy's body remaining, and the caster uses that option in the spell. However, if the caster uses the option where they speak the creatures name, the first time they cast the spell, Case (B) occurs. After this, Case (A) will occur.  
- Wish will result in Case (B) if the wish is not worded in a way that somehow specifically points to the Ceramorph and not the Gnome. (e.i "I wish Aggy Locamote was alive" would cause Case (B), but "I wish {my friend Aggy Locamote} / {Squiddle} was alive" would work.
