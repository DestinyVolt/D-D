Aggy Locamote is a train conductor for the Underdark Railway, a kindhearted individual whose dedication to the railway and its passengers is unmatched. She uses her skill in artifice and chronurgy to ensure that the train is always on time! However, Aggy has a secret she hides from almost everyone: When she was young, she was captured by Ilithid (mind flayers) and forced to undergo ceremorphosis, leaving her an aberration that must consume the brains of sentient creatures once a month in order to survive. Living in the Underdark, its not hard to find evildoers who she does not feel particularly bad about feeding off of, but she still feels some shame for her aberrant qualities. Despite this, she returned to work at the railroad, where her people were understanding of what occurred, and she eventually regained their trust. She learned how to disguise her true self, and continued to work as a conductor, until a strange turn of fate led her to meet up with a group of adventurers...

#### The One who Turned Me
I don't know the identity of the Mindflayer who turned me, but it has a distinct marking on it's head, a shocking white scar across the left eye, which is a misty red instead of it's normal white coloration.

#### The True Cephasians 
*Pronounced (Seh-fay-she-ans)* \
A group of Ceremorph Gnomes who are happy with their transformations. They have a small alcove deep in the Underdark, where they do experiments to replicate the process that turns Gnomes into Ceremorphs. They believe that they are a superior lifeform. Aggy doesn't know much about them, but an old friend of hers, Dortix Longdrop, joined up with them (He now calls himself Drellask). \

*Dortix Longdrop (nickname: "Whistlepult")* \
Longdorp was a friend of Squiddle (his nickname for her was Waywocket). Dortix was a talented illusionist, and helped hide the Dark Gnomes from the dominant races of the underdark, like Drow and Duergar. He was on the train that she was conducting when it was attacked by Mindflayers. He was converted into a Ceremorph as well, but was discovered by the Cephasians and his beliefs quickly fell in line with theirs. He wants Waywocket to join the Cephasians, but she is disgusted by the idea. 

#### The Underdark Railway
The Boss and his young daughter. Note: The Boss is a Union Man who lead the charge to overthrow the previous owners of the railway (the drow) 150 years ago, when it was just a tiny series of non-magical minecarts and railtracks. His daughter calls Aggy "Choochoo"\
A Tinkerer and her househusband \
An Engineer \
Her Ex-Conductor, Basically an Ex boyfriend. He broke up w/ her after she was transformed. His nickname for her was "Dimples." She gets sad whenever someone calls her that.  \
Kasfan Locamote (Father & Head Tinkerer, stereotypical gnomish tinkerer, very excentric, creates all sorts of crazy invetions to help the train line, loves to talk shop w/ Aggy) 

Note: Her Mother and Father never married, they don't live together, but they're still friends. It's not like there is any bad blood or anything, gnomes are just Like That(tm).  

#### The Fiddleblobs (Mother's side of the Family)
Note: Literally every member of this family has a slightly different last name and will correct you if you get it wrong. \
Ellidysa Fiddlelob \
Grand-pop Fiddleplop \
Grandma Fliddlelop \
(To the DM: Feel free to make more, please just tell me them. Squiddles got them memorized and considers this completely normal)
