Aggy Locamote is a train conductor for the Underdark Railway, a kindhearted individual whose dedication to the railway and its passengers is unmatched. She uses her skill in artifice and chronurgy to ensure that the train is always on time! However, Aggy has a secret she hides from almost everyone: When she was first working for the Railway, she was ambushed by Ilithid (mind flayers) and forced to undergo ceremorphosis, leaving her an aberration that must consume the brains of sentient creatures once a month in order to survive. Living in the Underdark, its not hard to find evildoers who she does not feel particularly bad about feeding off of, but she still feels some shame for her aberrant qualities. Despite this, she returned to work at the railroad, where her people were understanding of what occurred, and she eventually regained their trust. She learned how to disguise her true self, and continued to work as a conductor, until a strange turn of fate led her to meet up with a group of adventurers...

#### The One who Turned Me
I don't know the identity of the Mindflayer who turned me, but it has a distinct marking on it's head, a shocking white scar across the left eye, which is a misty red instead of it's normal white coloration.

#### The True Cephasians 
*Pronounced (Seh-fay-she-ans)* \
A group of Ceremorph Gnomes who are happy with their transformations. They have a small alcove deep in the Underdark, where they do experiments to replicate the process that turns Gnomes into Ceremorphs. They believe that they are a superior lifeform. Aggy doesn't know much about them, but an old friend of hers, Dortix Longdrop, joined up with them (He now calls himself Drellask). 

*Dortix "Drellask" Longdrop (nickname: "Whistlepult")* \
Longdorp was a friend of Squiddle (his nickname for her was Waywocket). Dortix was a talented illusionist, and helped hide the Rock Gnomes from the dominant races of the underdark, like Drow and Duergar. He was with Squiddle when they were attacked by Mindflayers. He was converted into a Ceremorph as well, but was discovered by the Cephasians and his beliefs quickly fell in line with theirs. He wants Waywocket to join the Cephasians, but she is disgusted by the idea. 

#### The Underdark Railway
There are 4 types of workers in the Underdark Railway: \
*Stationers:* People who don't actually work on the trains themselves, but are in charge of the upkeep of the railway stops. They handle all the financial stuff, and determine where new stops will be added. They usually live at one of the train stations. \
*Conductor:* Conductors are the ones who conduct the train, making the schedule, interacting with passengers, protecting the train from the dangers of the underdark, etc. \
*Engineer:* Engineers make sure that the train is working, shoveling coal, fixing breaks and repairing mechanisms. Many Conductors are also trained as Engineers, but some Conductors don't have the skill.\
*Tinkerer:* Tinkerers are the brains behind everything. They design the trains, build the archanotech that allows them to run, map out and design the railway, etc. 

Aggy is skilled as a Conductor, Engineer, and Tinkerer. All the following people have the format: Name (Aggy's Nickname for them).

*Fenton and Fizzy Striker (Bossman/Fenderbender and Dimple)* \
Fenton Striker, and his daughter, Fizzy Striker, are technically stationers, but more importantly, Fenton is The Boss. He's a Union Man who lead the the charge to overthrow the previous owners of the railway (the drow) 150 years ago, when it was just a series of non-magical minecarts and railtracks. Some people believe he has some dwarvish blood, with a big beard, deep voice, stout figure, and a hearty laugh. Regardless, he is highly respected by everyone who's part of the railroad. He accepted Aggy back into the railroad despite what happened to her, and ensured nobody mistreated her. His nicknames for her are Tentacles (pronounced like a philosopher, 'Tent-ah-cleese') and "Jackie". Fizzy is barely 10, a happy and niave little gnome who is doted on by her father. She calls her father "Pop" and he calls her "Bubbles". Fizzy's mother is unknown. She calls Aggy "Choochoo". 

*Gabilam and Mopton Babbleriver (Geebee and Muu)* \
Gabilam is a tinkerer, and a childhood friend of Aggy's. She works in the Tinker's workshop under Kasfan, and specializes in the design of new rails. She also helps rein in some of Kasfan's more... out there ideas, and often handles the more grounded aspects of the workshop (like finances). Mopton is her husband, a stationer, but is mostly just a stay at home husband. He cooks and cleans, and delivers Honey (his nickname for Gabi) her lunch everyday. He is absolutely infatuated with her. Gabilam's nickname for Aggy is Puddles, while Mopton calls her Noodles. 

*Wandlepop Spudnip (Spade)* \
An old conductor who trained Aggy on how to be one, after she was turned and her old conductor refused to work with her. He calls her Tadpole. He's almost certainly smuggles stuff on the trains, but Aggy is too trusting to notice. 

*Chomsky Frandlebim (Skylamp)* \
Her Ex-Conductor, basically an Ex-boyfriend. He broke up w/ her after she was transformed. His nickname for her was "Dear." She gets sad whenever someone calls her that. He calls her Egghead now. Kind of a dick. Runs a train that floats without needing the track. Probably has another engineer now, but Aggy doesn't know who it is.               

*Kasfan Locamote (Papa)* \
Aggy's Father & Head Tinkerer, stereotypical gnomish tinkerer, very excentric, creates all sorts of crazy invetions to help the train line, loves to talk shop w/ Aggy. Easily distracted and not very good with emotions. Nickname for Aggy is Periwinkle. He calls almost everyone in the shop simply by their first name, and they all call him Bigwig.

Note: Her Mother and Father never married, they don't live together, but they're still friends. It's not like there is any bad blood or anything, gnomes are just Like That(tm).
