### Racial Abilities
**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself. 

**Fortune from the Many.** If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can draw on your bonds of reciprocity to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses you finish a long rest. 

**Fey Gift** You can use the help action as a bonus action each day a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Whenever you use the help action, in addition to granting advantage, you can either grant yourself and the target 1d6+Prof temporary hit points or +10ft of movement, or you can give the target of the helped attack disadvantage on their next attack.

**Menacing** You have expertise in Intimidation, and you can replace one attack with an attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you.
