Backstory: The civilization she first investigated was the remains of her own clan. They were killed by frost giants, and she learned the Giant's language and runic abilities so that she could one day get revenge. Her egg was frozen during this attack and she hatched some 20 years later when the ice melted, long after the frost giants had left. She doesn't like bringing up that her clan is gone (Clans are central in dragonborn life, to the point that they lead with their clan name before their given name) so she just acts vague about it when asked and references them casually to put up an effort of them seeming alive. She was raised by Kobolds, who found her egg, who also imparted upon her the importance of the clan.
