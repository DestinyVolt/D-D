### Mastermaker Artificer 5
Battlefist: Your battlefist is a simple melee weapon, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. While your battlefist is a magical weapon, it can be infused as if it were a nonmagical weapon. 

#### Prosthesis Expertise
At 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can modify a clockwork limb, creating a permanent magical item that replaces a lost limb—a hand, arm, foot, leg, or similar body part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. The wearer can detach or reattach it as an action, and it can’t be removed against the wearer’s will. It detaches if the wearer dies.
