**Savage Attacks.** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit. Once per Rest, you can do this without needing to critically hit. \
**Reckless Attacks.** The first time you attack on your turn, you can choose to attack recklessly. Until the start of your next turn, all attacks you make, and all attacks against you, have advantage. 

### Bonus Actions:
Orcish Aggression: Dash towards hostile creature \
Barbarian's Rage (3/LR): \
\- Gain 4 THP and Resist BPS \
\- +2 Damage to all STR based attacks \
\- Treat Acrobatics, Stealth, Perception, and Intimidation as Strength Checks. \
\- At the start of your turn, grant 2d6 THP to ally. 

### Reactions
- Relentless Endurance (1/LR): When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead and make a Weapon Attack.
- Grapple-ing Hook: Whenever a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you, you can force it to make a DC 16 STR Save, or be entangled in your Grappling Hook. You can reduce their speed to 0, and may move them to a space within 5ft of you. 

### Worldly Barbarian 5
**Danger Sense.** You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see. \
**Powerful Build.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. \
**Grappling Hook.** You can make a DC 13 Acrobatics check to throw and attach your grappling hook to a location within 50ft.
