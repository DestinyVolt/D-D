**Savage Attacks.** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit. Once per Rest, you can do this without needing to critically hit. \
**Reckless Attacks.** The first time you attack on your turn, you can choose to attack recklessly. Until the start of your next turn, all attacks you make, and all attacks against you, have advantage. 

### Bonus Actions:
Orcish Aggression: Dash towards hostile creature \
Barbarian's Rage (3/LR): \
\- Gain 4 THP and Resist BPS \
\- +2 Damage to all STR based attacks \
\- At the start of your turn, grant 2d6 THP to ally \
\- Treat Acrobatics, Stealth, Perception, and Intimidation as Strength Checks.


### Reactions
- Relentless Endurance (1/LR): When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead and make a Weapon Attack.

### Worldly Barbarian 4
**Danger Sense.** You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see. \
**Powerful Build.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. \
