#### Given to Vomi, if we go down to kill the succubus.
Hey Vomi, I know I probably didn't leave the best impression, but if you're reading this, you had to kill me.
Thank you, really. I'd rather be dead then a slave. 
I know it's a lot to ask, but please take care of the party for me? 
I know you just met us, but we have the same goal, and they need someone to be the voice of reason. 
I guess it's silly, but I feel like I know you, that I can trust you with this. 
On the second piece of parchment, I left a list of my stuff, and who I think should have it. Give it to the party for me?

Ligh: 
- Spider Staff (Should be more efficient then your current one)
- Bag of Holding

Vomi: 
- Coin Purse of Holding (You seem like the only person who really knows the value of money)
- Talon (Just in case you need a magic weapon)

Ave: 
- All my spellbooks (I know you like to read, even though it's mostly alchemical formulas, you'll find some notes from me in it.
Don't sell them, please? I feel like a friend should have it...)
- Petro (Please take care of him. You're his favorite member of the party. My Books have the alchemical formula for reviving him from a statue if that happens, but i'm not sure if you can read them...)

Sarsariph: 
- Dragonguard Armor (I really feel like you should always have had it, honestly...)

Starflight: 
- Mercury [from alchemicy kit] (This might make a nice drink for you, huh?)

Petro: 
- Wand of Magic Missiles (Be careful, little buddy. I can't bring you back anymore...)
- Egg
