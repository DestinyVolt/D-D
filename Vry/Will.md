#### Given to Vomi, if we go down to kill the succubus.
Hey Vomi, I know I probably didn't leave the best impression, but if you're reading this, you had to kill me.
Thank you, really. I'd rather be dead then a slave. 
I know it's a lot to ask, but please take care of the party for me? 
I know you just met us, but we have the same goal, and they need someone to be the voice of reason. 
I guess it's silly, but I feel like I know you, that I can trust you with this. 
On the second piece of parchment, I left a list of my stuff, and who I think should have it. Give it to the party for me?

Hey everyone. If you're reading this, I'm dead. I'm sorry. Please don't blame anyone but me. It's my fault. I wish I could have spent more time with all of you. The time I spent with all of you was wonderful... Honestly you're the first people I could call friends in many years. I know it's wrong to ask favors of you now that I'm gone, but please... If you can, rescue Sacramento from the Path... If not, burn them to the ground. May the Traveler guide you all. 

- Arcana

Ligh: 
- Spider Staff (It's stronger than your current one. It allows you to cast a couple of magic spells too. Don't worry, they won't hurt you (or anyone else.)
- Bag of Holding

Vomi: 
- Coin Purse of Holding (You seem like the only person who really knows the value of money)
- Talon (Just in case you need a magic weapon)

Ave: 
- All my spellbooks (I know you like to read, even though it's mostly alchemical formulas, you'll find some notes from me in it.
Don't sell them, please? I feel like a friend should have it...)
- Petro (Please take care of him. You're his favorite member of the party. My Books have the alchemical formula for reviving him from a statue if he falls, but I'm not sure if you can read them...)

Sarsariph: 
- Dragonguard Armor (I really feel like you should always have had it, honestly...)
- Mercury [from alchemicy kit] (This might make a nice drink for Starflight)

- Wand of Magic Missiles (Be careful, little buddy. I can't bring you back anymore...)
- Egg
