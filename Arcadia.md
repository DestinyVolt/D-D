### Artificer 4
***Magical Inking:*** You can touch a tattoo and grant it one of the following properties. You can end the effect as an action, and can have a number of effects active equal to your Charisma modifier.
- The tattoo sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
- Whenever tapped by a creature, the tattoo emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
- The tattoo continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
- The tattoo temporarily reforms into a different shape. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.


***Right Tool for the Job:*** With thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. 

***Known Infusions***: You can have two infusions active at a time.\

### Racial Features
***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. \
***Cunning Intuition.*** Whenever you roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Performance) check, roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the total ability check. \
***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day.  While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

### Dark Experiment
***Spider Familiar.*** An [Ink-like Spider](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spider#content) can crawl out of the stigmata on your right hand. While the spider is not out, you gain a bonus to Perception equal to your Charisma modifier. You can see through the spider’s eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you. It does not need to sleep, and can alert you to something as a bonus action. In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours. You can resummon the spider at the end of a short or long rest. 

***Inkling Familiar.*** An [Inkling Demon](https://5e.tools/bestiary/inkling-mascot-scc.html) can crawl out of the stigmata on your left hand. You can see through the Inkling’s eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you. When you cast a Touch spell, you can use the Inkling's reaction to cast it from the Inkling's position. Once per Day, or by spending a second level spell slot, you can swap places with the familiar. You can take the Attack action to cause it to attack instead with its reaction. 

***Dragon Homunculus Infusion.*** An [Colorful Inked Dragon](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=homunculus-servant) can fly off of the tattoo on your right arm. You must use a Bonus action to command this familiar on your turn, or it takes the Dodge action. It regains 2d6 HP when the mending spell is cast on it. The homunculus can deliver a spell you cast that has a range of touch if it is within 120 feet of you.
