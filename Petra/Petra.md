#### Abilities
Stone's Durability
Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. You can use an action to make your AC 13 + your CON mod. 

Stone Aegis \
As a bonus action, you can grant an aegis to one allied creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 2 + your sorcerer level divided by 4. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated. \
In addition, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you hits the protected target with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker. You can then make one melee weapon attack against the attacker.

Cunning Action \
You can Dash, Disengage, or Hide as a Bonus Action. Immediately after you do, you can use your Bolt from the Grave, using up your Sneak Attack.

Revived Nature \
You don't need to sleep, eat, breath, or drink. \
To take a long rest, you must remain motionless for 4 hours, during which you can still hear. \
You have advantage on saving throws against Disease and Poison, and have resistance to poison damage. \
