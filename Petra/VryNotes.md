## Notes: 
These are found throughout several pages of unreadable alchemical symbols, equations, recipes, etc. 

#### Race
She's probably a wood elf? The stone is old, it's likely she's been stuck this way for a while.

#### Stone Cursed
The ritual seems to have failed, but it was at least mostly completed. The Obsidian skull is in her chest, and it seems to have trapped a bunch of magical energy, a weird mix of Necrotic, Enchantment, and Transmutation magic.

#### Curing Petrification 
Curing any part of the body seems to be temporary, as the stone grows back over. It seems like without the stone the flesh can't survive. Completely curing petrification will likely kill her.

#### Alchemical Claws
The clumpy liquid that flows from the hands seem to some form of acid, but the magical gasious effect around it seems to be necrotic in nature. 

#### Detect thoughts
Potion of Mind Reading worked, but it's kind of a mess in there. I got her name tho: ~~Xanaphia~~ (why adult name??)

#### Name:
~~Naeris~~ \
~~Adrie~~ \
**Petra** \
She appears to be trancing. I have no idea what her name actually is so I'm calling her Petra.

Her mind seems shattered, like she can't exit trance. She may have been trapped for too long. I'm gonna try talking her with Message and snap her out of it. 

*[Several Pages of pure alchemical formulas clearly written over several days]*

#### BROKE TRANCE!!!! MESSAGE GOT TO PETRA AND SHE RESPONDED WITH THOUGHTS. 
REMINDER: MAKE ANOTHER POTION OF MIND READING IN THE MORNING

*[Several More Pages of pure alchemical formulas clearly written over several days]*

#### This should work!
2 Parts Petro's Revival Potion + 1 Parts Water + 3 Crushed up Goodberries. (Mix well and apply to mouth.) \
Should break the petrification and Stone-Curse temprement, while keeping the living stone enchantment. Might have some weird effects involving teleportation due to using a techinque similar to familiars, but I'm sure it'll be fine. \
REMINDER: Ask Ave once we get back tommorow to help me explain everything to Petra! I can't make enough Mind reading potions and I get the feeling Ave and Petra will like each other. Should probably make sure everyone is there when I cure her though.
