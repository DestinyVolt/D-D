# Mage Of Witherbloom (Revised)
***Mages of Witherbloom draw their magic from the energy that endlessly flows from life to death, and back again. They see the duality of thriving life and inevitable death in all things, tapping and manipulating the transition of energy between these states. Some Witherbloom adherents focus on vital energies to nurture life and empower others, while others embrace the drain of vitality into decay to sap and strike down their foes.***

### Witherbloom Spells
*Level 1+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature* \
You learn the cantrip Spare the Dying. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Witherbloom Spells table.

Each of these spells count as a class spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of spells you know. If you are a druid, you always have the spells prepared, and they don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

| Level  | Spells |
| --- | ------------- | 
| 1st  | Cure Wounds, Inflict Wounds  |
| 3rd  | Lesser Restoration, Wither and Bloom  |
| 5th  | Revivify, Vampiric Touch |
| 7th  | Blight, Aura of Life |
| 9th  | Antilife Shell, Mass Cure Wounds |

### Essence Tap
*Level 1+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature* \
As a bonus action, you can draw on a reservoir of life essence to empower yourself for 1 minute, or until you use this feature again. For the duration, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice:

- **Overgrowth**. When you choose this benefit, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns while the benefit lasts, you can expend and roll one Hit Die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
- **Withering Strike**. When you deal damage or cast a spell that deals damage, you can change the damage type to necrotic, and the damage ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Witherbloom Brew
*Level 6+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature* \
You gain proficiency with herbalism kits. If you already have proficiency with herbalism kits, you gain proficiency with poisoner's kits or a set of Artisan's Tools of your choice.

When you finish a long rest, you can use an herbalism kit and a pot or cauldron to create magical brews. You create a number of brews equal to your proficiency bonus. Each brew requires its own flask. A brew retains its magical potency for 24 hours or until it is used. For each brew, choose one of the following effects:
- **Fortifying.** When you create this brew, choose a damage type from the following list: cold, fire, necrotic, poison, or radiant. A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient gains resistance to the chosen damage type for 1 hour.
- **Quickening.** A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient regains 2d6 hit points, and one disease or condition from the following list affecting the recipient ends (brew user’s choice): charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned.
- **Toxifying.** As an action, a creature can apply this brew to a simple or martial weapon. The next time the weapon or a piece of ammunition fired by it hits a creature within 1 hour, the target takes 2d6 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned for 1 minute.

### Witherbloom Adept
*Level 10+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature* \
Your connection to the flow of life force deepens. Once per turn when a spell you cast deals necrotic damage or restores hit points, one target of the spell takes additional damage or regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

Additionally, the following effect is now among your Witherbloom Brew options:
- **Purifying.** When you create this brew, a diamond worth at least 100gp must be consumed in the brewing process, or the brew has no effect. A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient's exhaustion level is reduced by 1, and one curse or effect from the following list affecting the recipient ends (brew user’s choice): charmed, petrified, maximum HP reduction, or ability score reduction.

### Withering Vortex
*Level 14+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature* \
When you cast a spell using a spell slot that deals necrotic damage to any number of creatures that aren’t Undead or Constructs, choose one of the creatures that took damage. You drain an amount of life energy equal to half the damage dealt to the chosen creature. One creature other than yourself that you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the life energy drained.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Design Notes
The fact that the original subclass had Greater Restoration (a 5th level spell) being gained at level 7 (when you cannot cast it) was what originally inspired me to revise this subclass, it's such a silly mistake. That said, I can see why it happened. Antilife Shell, Greater Restoration, and Mass Cure Wounds all feel like they should be given to this subclass, and there is a hilarious dearth of druidic "Life" spells that could replace it at 4th level. After expanding to all spell lists, I ended up going with Aura of Life, as the other contender, Death Ward, is quite powerful when combined with a Warlock's short rest spell slot recovery. 

That said, Greater Restoration absolutely should be accessible to this subclass, so I added an additional brew to the Witherbloom Adept. This is better in that it does not cost a 5th level spell slot, but worse in the sense that it must be prepared at the beginning of the day. I think this encourages planning and fits the vibe of the subclass well, having to return home to concoct a witchy brew as opposed to instantly fixing something. 

The final change made was to slightly reword the necrotic damage buffs to clearly apply to spells such as Magic Stone, Find Familiar, Shadow Blade, Flame Blade, Glyph of Warding, and Spirit of Death.
