# Wild Maverick
***In the world of artifice, the Wild Maverick is categorized as "loose cannons" and "performing egregious abuse of the Weave." These fighters augment their martial mastery with magical prowess, but unlike Eldritch Knights and Artificers, they replace careful study and reliable invention with alchemical concoctions and infusions that are just barely on this side of functional. Critics say that the swirling wild magic of a Maverick's gimmicks are just as likely to blow up in their own face as they are an enemy's. Regardless, a Wild Maverick is a terrifying force on the battlefield.***

### Alchemical Savant
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice. 

Additionally, you gain the ability to create Breakaway Vials for storing potions. They are a ranged weapon with range (30/90) and the thrown and finesse properties with which you are proficient. On a hit, they do not deal damage. You can convert a normal vial into one of these over the course of a short rest. 

### Wild Gimmicks
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with radically unreliable magical knowledge.

**Cantrips**\
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. You learn an additional artificer cantrip of your choice at 10th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Wild Gimmicks feature with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.
 
**Spell Slots**\
The Wild Maverick Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to fuel your Wild Gimmicks. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

**Wild Gimmicks known**\
When you gain this feature, you learn two Wild Gimmick options of your choice (see "Wild Gimmick Options" below). If a Wild Gimmick has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the Gimmick. 

You gain an additional Wild Gimmick option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one Wild Gimmick you know with another Wild Gimmick from the list.

**Spellcasting Ability**\
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wild Gimmick spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC and spell attack modifier for a Wild Gimmick spell you cast.

Spell Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Quick Fingers
Starting 7th Level, you can use a bonus action to take the Use an Object action or Ready the Use an Object action.

### Alchemical Expertise
At 7th level, you gain expertise with alchemist's supplies. 

Additionally, if you use a non-magical object that forces a Saving Throw, you can use your Spell Save DC in place of the default DC. 

### Improved Wild Gimmicks
Beginning at 7th level, whenever you expend a spell slot to fuel a Wild Gimmick, you can do so as if using a spell slot one level higher than the spell slot you expend.

### Wild Legerdemain 
Starting at 15th level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Quick Fingers to activate a Wild Gimmick that normally requires an action to use. 

### Incendiary Chaos
Starting at 18th level, once per long rest, you can use an action to magically create a Gnomengarde Grenade. If not used by dawn, the Gnomengarde Grenade explodes immediately. 

## Wild Gimmick Options

### Spellstrung Projectile
When you select this Wild Gimmick option, choose a school of magic other than Dunamancy and Divination. This Gimmick option can be taken multiple times, each time selecting a different school of magic. 

You can use your action to expend a spell slot and imbue a thrown weapon or piece of ammunition with the following property until the end of your next long rest:

When you make a ranged attack with the projectile, but before you choose a target, the Dungeon Master will randomly determine a leveled spell of the selected school that is no more than one level higher than the expended spell slot. Knowing the spell, you must select a target for the attack. The target of the attack (or the location of the target), also becomes the target of the spell. Hit or Miss, the magic on the projectile fades. 

If the spell requires concentration, you need not concentrate on the spell.

### Improvised Equipment
You can use your action to expend a spell slot and magically create a number of pieces of equipment equal to the spell slot level from the following list: Acid (vial), Alchemist's Fire (flask), Antitoxin (vial), Ball Bearings (bag of 1,000), Caltrops (bag of 20), Holy Water (flask), Hunting Trap, Oil (flask), Basic Poison (vial), Net, Smoke Bomb

Anything you create using this feature is unreliable in the hands of anyone other than you, and as such, cannot be sold to or used by others. You however, are considered proficient with any of these when used to make an attack. You can only have a number of pieces of equipment created with this feature equal to twice your profiency bonus. 

### Airborne Potions
You can use your action to expend a spell slot and magically transform a potion. The vessel the potion is in becomes a Breakaway Vial, and the potion becomes gaseous until the end of your next long rest. While the potion is gaseous, if you hit a creature with the breakaway vial, they gain the benefits of the potion. For every level above first of the slot expended, you can choose one creature within 5ft of the original target to gain the benefits of the potion.

If you do not have a potion, you can instead create a gaseous Potion of Healing (Common), which loses its potency at the end of your next long rest. For every two spell levels above 1st, the rarity of the Potion of Healing increases by one level. 

### Wild Magic Projectile (7th Level or Higher)
You can use your action to expend a 2nd level or higher spell slot and imbue a thrown weapon or piece of ammunition with the following property until the end of your next long rest:

When you make a ranged attack with the projectile, after selecting a target but before rolling to hit, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table. Declare whether you want you or the target of the attack to be considered the source of the Wild Magic Surge, then make the attack. On a hit, the Wild Magic Surge originates from the creature you selected. On a miss, it originates from the non-intended creature. Hit or Miss, the magic on the projectile fades. 

If the wild magic surge creates a spell, it does not require concentration.

### Spellhavoc Projectile (15th Level or Higher)
You can use your action to expend a 3nd level or higher spell slot and imbue a thrown weapon or piece of ammunition with the following property until the end of your next long rest:

As a reaction to a creature you can see casting a spell, you can make an attack with the Spellhavoc Projectile against the triggering creature. On a hit, the spellcasting fails, and the struck creature rolls on the Wild Magic Surge table. A creature may use a Legendary Resistance to cause the spellcasting to not fail, but the Wild Magic Surge occurs regardless.
