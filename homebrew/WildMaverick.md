### Alchemical Savant
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with radically unreliable magical knowledge.

**Cantrips**\
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. You learn an additional artificer cantrip of your choice at 10th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Wild Gimmicks feature with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

The Wild Maverick Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to fuel your Wild Gimmicks. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

**Wild Gimmicks known**\
When you gain this feature, you learn two Wild Gimmick options of your choice (see "Wild Gimmick Options" below).

You gain an additional Wild Gimmick option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one Wild Gimmick you know with another Wild Gimmick from the list.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wild Gimmick spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC and spell attack modifier for a Wild Gimmick spell you cast.
