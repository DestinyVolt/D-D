# Wild Maverick
***In the world of artifice, Wild Mavericks are categorized as "loose cannons" and "performing egregious abuse of the Weave." These fighters augment their martial mastery with magical prowess, but unlike Eldritch Knights and Artificers, they replace careful study and reliable invention with alchemical concoctions and infusions that are just barely on this side of functional. Critics say that the swirling wild magic of a Maverick's gimmicks are just as likely to blow up in their own face as they are an enemy's. Regardless, a Wild Maverick is a terrifying force on the battlefield.***

### Alchemical Savant
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice. 

Additionally, you gain the ability to create Breakaway Vials for storing potions. They are a ranged weapon with range (30/90) and the thrown, light, and finesse properties with which you are proficient. On a hit, they do not deal damage. Hit or Miss, they are always destroyed in the process of making an attack with them. You can create one of these over the course of a short rest. 

### Wild Gimmicks
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with radically unreliable magical knowledge.

**Cantrips**\
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. You learn an additional artificer cantrip of your choice at 10th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Wild Gimmicks feature with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.
 
**Spell Slots**\
The Wild Maverick Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to fuel your Wild Gimmicks. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

**Wild Gimmicks known**\
When you gain this feature, you learn two Wild Gimmick options of your choice (see "Wild Gimmick Options" below). If a Wild Gimmick has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the Gimmick. 

You gain an additional Wild Gimmick option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th, 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one Wild Gimmick you know with another Wild Gimmick from the list.

**Spellcasting Ability**\
You've gained experience in this trade not through tedious book study or careful training, but instead through trial and error in the workshop and on the battlefield. Your hands are likely covered in burn marks and scars that represent hundreds of failed experiments before you figured out how to properly harness wild magic. 

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your Wild Gimmick spells. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC and spell attack modifier for a Wild Gimmick spell you cast.

Spell Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

### Quick Fingers
Starting 7th Level, you can use a bonus action to take the Use an Object action or Ready the Use an Object action.

### Alchemical Expertise
At 7th level, you gain expertise with alchemist's supplies. 

Additionally, if you use a non-magical object that forces a Saving Throw, you can use your Spell Save DC in place of the default DC. 

### Improved Wild Gimmicks
Beginning at 10th level, whenever you expend a spell slot to fuel a Wild Gimmick, you can do so as if expending a spell slot one level higher than the spell slot you expend.

### Wild Legerdemain 
Starting at 15th level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Quick Fingers to activate a Wild Gimmick that normally requires an action to use. 

### Incendiary Chaos
Starting at 18th level, once per long rest, you can use an action to magically create a Gnomengarde Grenade in your hand. If not used by dawn, the Gnomengarde Grenade explodes immediately. 

## Wild Gimmick Options

### Spellstrung Projectile
When you select this Wild Gimmick option, choose a school of magic other than Dunamancy and Divination. This Gimmick option can be taken multiple times, each time selecting a different school of magic. 

You can use your action to expend a spell slot and imbue a thrown weapon or piece of ammunition with the following property until the end of your next long rest:

When you make a ranged attack with the projectile, but before you choose a target, the Dungeon Master will randomly determine a leveled spell of the selected school that is within one level of expended spell slot. Knowing the spell, you must select a target for the attack. The target of the attack (or the location of the target), also becomes the target of the spell. The spell takes effect immediately, regardless of casting time, at the level of the expended slot. Hit or Miss, the magic on the projectile fades. 

If the spell requires concentration, you need not concentrate on the spell.

### Improvised Equipment
You can use your action to expend a spell slot and magically create a number of pieces of equipment equal to the spell slot level from the following list: Acid (vial), Alchemist's Fire (flask), Antitoxin (vial), Ball Bearings (bag of 1,000), Caltrops (bag of 20), Holy Water (flask), Hunting Trap, Oil (flask), Basic Poison (vial), Net, Smoke Bomb

Anything you create using this feature is unreliable in the hands of anyone other than you, and as such, cannot be sold to or used by others. You however, are considered proficient with any of these when used to make an attack. You can only have a number of pieces of equipment created with this feature equal to twice your profiency bonus. 

### Airborne Potions
You can use your action to expend a spell slot and magically transform a potion. The vessel the potion is in becomes a Breakaway Vial, and the potion becomes gaseous until the end of your next long rest. While the potion is gaseous, if you hit a creature with the breakaway vial, they gain the benefits of the potion. For every level above first of the slot expended, you can choose one creature within 5ft of the original target to gain the effects of the potion.

If you do not have a potion, you can instead create a gaseous Potion of Healing (Common), which loses its potency at the end of your next long rest. For every two spell levels above 1st, the rarity of the Potion of Healing increases by one level. 

### Wild Magic Projectile (7th Level or Higher)
You can use your action to expend a 2nd level or higher spell slot and imbue a thrown weapon or piece of ammunition with the following property until the end of your next long rest:

When you make a ranged attack with the projectile, after selecting a target but before rolling to hit, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table. Declare whether you want you or the target of the attack to be considered the source of the Wild Magic Surge, then make the attack. On a hit, the Wild Magic Surge originates from the creature you selected. On a miss, it originates from the non-intended creature. Hit or Miss, the magic on the projectile fades. 

If the wild magic surge creates a spell, it does not require concentration.

### Wild Mutagenics (7th Level or Higher)
While holding a set of alchemy tools, you may use your action to expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher and transform a vial of liquid into a Mutagen. The Mutagen may be any mutagen from the [Mutant Bloodhunter list](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:mutagens) that does not have a prerequisite. Once ingested, the mutagen's effect lasts until you consume another mutagen or you finish a short or long rest, whichever comes first. The Mutagen is attuned to your specific biology. If any other creature consumes the mutagen, they must make a Constitution save against your Wild Gimmick DC. On a success, they gain the benefits of the Mutagen. Regardless of a success or failure, they suffer the downsides of the Mutagen.

### Unreliable Potions (10th level or Higher)
While holding a set of alchemy tools, you may use your action to expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher and transform a vial of liquid into a chaotic brew. When you take the action, make a DC 5 Intelligence (Alchemy Tools) check. On a failure, the spell slot is wasted. On a success, you may roll on the Unreliable Potions table. The brew has the effect of the described potion. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you may remove one option from the table for every 5 points you exceeded the DC by. If you expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the DC increases to 10 and you may roll twice on the table. The potion has the effects of both results. 

#### Unreliable Potions Table
| d8 | Concoction | 
| --- | -------- | 
| 1 | Potion of Healing (Rarity as described by Airborne Potions) | 
| 2 | Potion of Climbing | 
| 3 | Potion of Resistance (Roll to determine damage type, removing as many options as you removed from this table) | 
| 4 | Potion of Fire Breath (Uses your Gimmick DC) |  
| 5 | Potion of Growth | 
| 6 | Potion of Diminution | 
| 7 | Oil of Slipperiness (Uses your Gimmick DC) | 
| 8 | Elixir of Health |  

### Wild Weaponry (10th level or higher)
You can use your action to expend a spell slot and imbue a weapon with chaotic magic, granting the following property until the end fo your next long rest:

Whenever a creature would roll a d20 to attack with the weapon, they instead roll the dice associated with the level of the expended spell slot in the "Wild Weaponry" table. The maximum roll on the die is considered a critical hit. Whenever a Wild Die rolls a 1, the associated Wild Effect occurs, listed in the "Wild Dice" table. If multiple dice are listed as the Wild Die for a weapon, both dice are rolled in place of each d20, and are summed together. If either die rolls a 1, the Wild Effect occurs. If either die rolls its maximum value, the attack is a critical hit.

#### Wild Weaponry Table
| Spell Slot Level | Die | Wild Effect |
| ------------- | -------- | --- |
| 2nd | 1d16 | The weapon releases its magic, dealing 1d16 force damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it, and the Wild Gimmick ends. |
| 3rd | 1d24 | The weapon releases protective magic, allowing the wielder to roll a d24 in place of a d20 on their next saving throw. |
| 4th | 1d30 | The Weapon uses a d30 as its damage die until the wielder successfully deals damage with it. |
| 5th | 2d16 | The weapon duplicates, dropping a temporary copy of itself that lasts until the end of your next long rest. The copy has the 2nd level slot Wild Effect in place of this one. 

### Spellhavoc Projectile (15th Level or Higher)
You can use your action to expend a 3rd level or higher spell slot and imbue a thrown weapon or piece of ammunition with the following property until the end of your next long rest:

As a reaction to a creature you can see casting a spell, you can make an attack with the Spellhavoc Projectile against the triggering creature. On a hit, the spellcasting fails, and the struck creature rolls on the Wild Magic Surge table. A creature may use a Legendary Resistance to cause the spellcasting to not fail, but the Wild Magic Surge occurs regardless.
