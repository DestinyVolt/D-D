# Giant Soul
***The giants once dwelled in a fabled realm known as Ostoria, a paradise for their folk that reflected their mastery of the mortal realm. In time, Ostoria fell, and the giants were scattered and broken. During that mythic era, the giants granted a few chosen individuals among the small folk a shard of their great power. These favored people were caught in the same tragedy that sundered Ostoria. Since that time, they have spread across the many worlds of the multiverse. Now and again, one of their descendants manifests the gifts imparted by the giants, granting them sorcerous magic that allows them to command the elements and gain the might of a giant.***

Additionally, if your size is Large or larger, you have a base AC of 14 + your Constitution modifier, so long as you are not wearing any armor or using a shield.

### Mark of the Ordning
At 1st level, you discover innate magical abilities within yourself that are based on your giant heritage. Select one of the giant types from the Mark of the Ordning table. At 1st and 3rd level, you learn the spells associated with your choice, as well as the universal giant spells, as shown on the table. These spells count as sorcerer spells for you, but they don’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known.

### Colossus Sorcery
Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a first level spell Mark of the Ordning spell, or Enlarge / Reduce targetting yourself, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level. If you cast the spell using sorcery points, the spell's duration increases tenfold, and it does not require concentration.

### Rage of Fallen Ostoria
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to channel the souls of your ancestors into your physical form. When you start casting a sorcerer spell on your turn and expend a spell slot, you can increase your size by one category – from Medium to Large, for example. This increase lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you die or are incapacitated. Until it ends, you gain the following benefits:

- Your current hit points and your hit point maximum both increase by 1 per sorcerer level.
- Your reach increases by 5 feet.
- Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of your melee weapon attacks; the bonus equals your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Blessing of the All Father
At 18th level, your Constitution score increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22.

In addition, you can now use Rage of Fallen Ostoria twice between rests, but no more than once on a turn. If you use that feature while under its effects, its increases to your size, hit points, reach, and walking speed are cumulative.
