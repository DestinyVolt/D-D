# Giant Soul
***The giants once dwelled in a fabled realm known as Ostoria, a paradise for their folk that reflected their mastery of the mortal realm. In time, Ostoria fell, and the giants were scattered and broken. During that mythic era, the giants granted a few chosen individuals among the small folk a shard of their great power. These favored people were caught in the same tragedy that sundered Ostoria. Since that time, they have spread across the many worlds of the multiverse. Now and again, one of their descendants manifests the gifts imparted by the giants, granting them sorcerous magic that allows them to command the elements and gain the might of a giant.***

### Jotun Resilience
The resilience of giants flows through your body. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Additionally, if your size is Large or larger, you have a base AC of 14 + your Constitution modifier, so long as you are not wearing any armor or using a shield.

### Mark of the Ordning
At 1st level, you discover innate magical abilities within yourself that are based on your giant heritage. Select one of the giant types from the Mark of the Ordning table. At 1st and 3rd level, you learn the spells associated with your choice, as well as the universal giant spells, as shown on the table. These spells count as sorcerer spells for you, but they don’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known.

| Giant Type	  | Spells at 1st Level | Spells at 2nd Level |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| All  | Shillelagh  | Enlarge / Reduce |
| Hill  | Wrathful Smite, Resistance  | Earthbind |
| Stone  | Ensnaring Strike, Magic Stone  | Spike Growth |
| Frost  | Armor of Agathys, Ray of Frost  | Hold Person |
| Fire  | Searing Smite, Produce Flame  | Heat Metal |
| Cloud  | Zypher Strike, Gust  | Invisiblity |
| Storm  | Thundrous Smite, Shocking Grasp | Gust of Wind |

### Soul of Lost Ostoria
Starting at 6th level, you gain a benefit whenever you cast one of the spells granted by your Mark of the Ordning Feature. 
- **Hill Giant.** Immediately after a creature fails a save against any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, you can knock them prone. If the spell was Earthbind, they cannot stand up from prone until the spell ends. 
- **Stone Giant.** Immediately after you cast any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, you gain a bonus to AC equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1) until the end of your next turn.
- **Frost Giant.** Immediately after you cast any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). If the spell is Armor of Agathys, you instead increase its temporary hit points by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).
- **Fire Giant.** You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of your Mark of the Ordning spells. The bonus equals your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).
- **Cloud Giant.** Immediately after you cast any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, you can magically teleport to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you that you can see. 
- **Storm Giant.** Immediately after you cast any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you take lightning damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

### Colossus Sorcery
Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a first level spell Mark of the Ordning spell, or Enlarge / Reduce targetting yourself, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level. If you cast the spell using sorcery points, the spell's duration increases tenfold, and it does not require concentration.

### Rage of Fallen Ostoria
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to channel the souls of your ancestors into your physical form. When you start casting a sorcerer spell on your turn and expend a spell slot, you can increase your size by one category – from Medium to Large, for example. This increase lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you die or are incapacitated. Until it ends, you gain the following benefits:

- Your current hit points and your hit point maximum both increase by 1 per sorcerer level.
- Your reach increases by 5 feet.
- Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of your melee weapon attacks; the bonus equals your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Blessing of the All Father
At 18th level, your Constitution score increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22.

In addition, you can now use Rage of Fallen Ostoria twice between rests, but no more than once on a turn. If you use that feature while under its effects, its increases to your size, hit points, reach, and walking speed are cumulative.


#### Design Notes
This subclass is designed on the following assumptions:
- Sorcerer will be the main class of the player. This subclass cannot be "dipped" into without explicit DM permission. Jotun Resilience is far too tempting for a Giant Barbarian or a Rune Knight, in my opinion. 
- Tensor's Transformation should be on the Sorcerer spell list. I highly suggest allowing the player to learn the spell on level up, but if not, granting it to them as part of Rage of Fallen Ostoria would be appropriate.
- The 14 + CON modifier was chosen as a compromised version of the Stone Sorcerer's equivalent ability, which was only 13 + CON, but gave proficiency in and allowed use of a shield, and did not require resource expenditure like this subclass.
- I would allow creatures who wield Adamatine Weapons or have the Siege Monster Feature to ignore or even remove the Stone Giant's Mark of Ordning AC bonus, partially for balance reasons and partially for thematics. I might even extend this to Legendary creatures in general. 
- Do not use a variant of sorcerer that uses Constitution as a casting stat with this subclass.
- People who multiclass this class with Rune Scribe get a cookie. It's thematically appropriate and cool, and also MAD as hell.

#### Notes for Rulings
- Colossus Sorcery only works on the first level spells and Enlarge. It does not work on the Type-specific second level spells. That would be nuts. It is designed to remove the annoying concentration components of the Smite/Strike spells and Enlarge, so that using the main mechanics of the subclass do not *weaken* your character (because concentration is that valuable.)
- The Fire Giant bonus to attack rolls does not apply to Shillealagh. This is RAW, but I wanted to spell it out. Shillelagh modifies the weapon, the *spell* is not dealing any damage, so it does not get the bonus.
- Using the As-Written rules for Bonus Action casting is important for this subclass. It helps balance the concentrationless spells, encourages forethought on spell usage, and stops Stone Giants and Frost Giants from just getting free AC or THP as a bonus action *every turn.*
