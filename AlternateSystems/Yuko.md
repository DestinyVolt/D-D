Link (Minor Action): Create a link between two enemies or two allies within a range of 0-2, which can include yourself. 
You must designate a primary and secondary target for the link when you create it. 
Any time any effect (damage, status effects, healing, talent effects, etc.) affects the primary target, 
you may choose to give the secondary target a copy of the same effect as a free action. A link
will end at the end of the scene, or when you create a different link.

Powerdampening (Free Action, 1 / Scene): If once of the dice on a magical action comes up a 1, you can remove 1 point of Overcharge from an ally.

Boost (Free Action, 3/Scene, 1 Overcharge): 
When making a magical challenge, you can take 1 Overcharge on the magical attribute you’re using for the challenge to roll an additional die and add it to your result. 
This die will give you another die and another point of Overcharge if it rolls a 6 as usual, and if you use it for an attack it gives +2 to the attack’s damage as usual.

Battle Sorcery: (Passive) +3 to Combat Sorcery
