**Illithid Bite:**
While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with your bite. When you use your bite and hit a creature that isn’t a Construct or an Undead, you can either regain hit points equal to the damage dealt by the bite or gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make equal to the damage dealt by the bite. You can empower yourself with your bite a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Background Feature: Steady
You can move twice the normal amount of time (up to 16 hours) each day before being subject to the effect of a forced march. Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.

### Personality
I'm always ready to make a new friend! \
My responsibility as a train conductor comes first! I have to make sure all my passengers are comfortable, and that nothing stands in the way of the train. \
Helping people makes me happy :) \
I love life, and want to live it to the fullest, even if I'm ashamed of what I am. \
I don't really like lying, but I will if it means helping a friend or hiding my curse. \
(Bond) My clan of gnomes help run the Underdark Railway. I'm friends with most of them, and they know my true nature. \
(Bond) I was taken by mindflayers and turned into this form. I hate all illithid. \
(Flaw) I'm very easily peer pressured into things. \
(Flaw) I'm overly nice to people who are rude to me, so long as they don't get violent. \
(Flaw) I need to eat a brain once a month.

Waterskin, 50ft of Rope, Tinderbox, 10 Pitons \
Tool Kit (counts as Thieves' and Tinker's Tools, can be used as a spellcasting focus): \

#### Future Levels:
**Wizard 1:** \
Cantrips: Prestidigitation, Mending, Mind Sliver \
1st: Alarm, Find Familiar, Detect Magic, Tenser's Floating Disk, Identify, Shield 

**Arcane Recovery:**
You can recover half your Wizard Level's worth of Spell Slot levels on a short rest once per day. 

**Wizard 2:** \
Subclass: Chronurgy \
1st: Gift of Alacrity, Magnify Gravity

**Chronal Shift:**
At 2nd level, you can magically exert limited control over the flow of time around a creature. As a reaction, after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can force the creature to reroll. You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll. You can use this ability twice, and you regain any expended use when you finish a long rest.

**Temporal Awareness** \
Starting at 2nd level, you can add your Intelligence modifiers to your initiative rolls.

**Wizard 3:** \
Immovable Object, Hold Person

**Wizard 4:** \
Mirror Image, Phantasmal Force \
Consume Brain (Booming Blade but Psychic) \
Mounted Combatant

**Wizard 5:** \
Slow, Tiny Servant 

**Wizard 6:**
Pulse Wave, Haste \
Temporal Freeze Ability \
Note: This is when we get fourth level spell slots. Absolutely critical before going back to artificer. Honestly considering just sticking wizard, since 7 gives an extra level 4 spell slot and 2 more spells (probably won't actually pick level 4 spells, just more level 3s, and 8 gives an ability score increase, allowing me to take fey-touched for dissonant whispers at the same time I would get it with the artificer dip. 


**Artificer 2:**
+1 Prepared Spell \
Infusions:
- Homunculus (Intellect Devourer)
- Enhanced Arcane Focus
- Bag of Holding
- Wand of Secrets

**Artificer 3:**
Right Tool for the Job \
Archivist: \
Skills: Nature, Insight \
Homunculus Upgrade (Information Overload Psychic Attack, Use It's Senses, etc) \
Comprehend Languages, *Dissonant Whispers*

Past this point, probably go back into Wizard, just for the spell slots. Focus more on upcasting then new spells, might even grab lower level spells. 

#### Look for Spell Scrolls: 
1st: Continual Flame \
2nd: Find Vehicle \
3rd: Leomund's Tiny Hut, Glyph of Warding, Counterspell,  Vampiric Touch (Change to Psychic Damage for eating a brain?), Phantom Steed
