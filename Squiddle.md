I'm always ready to make a new friend! \
My responsibility as a train conductor comes first! I have to make sure all my passengers are comfortable, and that nothing stands in the way of the train. \
Helping people makes me happy :) \
I love life, and want to live it to the fullest, even if I'm ashamed of what I am. \
I don't really like lying, but I will if it means helping a friend or hiding my curse. \
(Bond) My clan of gnomes help run the Underdark Railway. I'm friends with most of them, and they know my true nature. \
(Bond) I was taken by mindflayers and turned into this form. I hate all illithid. \
(Flaw) I'm very easily peer pressured into things. \
(Flaw) I'm overly nice to people who are rude to me, so long as they don't get violent. \
(Flaw) I need to eat a brain once a month.
