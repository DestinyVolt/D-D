### Level 3 Battlemaster
**Interception:** As a reaction, you can reduce the damage taken by an ally within range by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus. \
**Second Wind:** As a bonus action, you can heal yourself for 1d10+level HP. \
**Action Surge:** Once per rest, you can take a second Action during your turn. \
You have 5d8 superiority dice. \
**Commander's Strike:** Forgo one of your attacks so your ally can make an attack as a reaction. Add a superiority die to their damage roll. \
**Commanding Precense:** Add a superiority die to an Indimidation, Persuasion, or Performance check. \
**Manuevering Attack:** After making an attack, add a superiority die of damage to it, and an ally may move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. 


### Racial Abilities
**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself. 

**Fortune from the Many.** If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can draw on your bonds of reciprocity to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses you finish a long rest. 

**Fey Gift / Tandem Tactician** You can use the help action as a bonus action, and when you use it, it has a range of 15 ft and can target 2 allies attacking the same hostile creature. In addition to granting advantage, you can either grant yourself and the target 1d6+Prof temporary hit points or +10ft of movement, or you can give the target of the helped attack disadvantage on their next attack.
