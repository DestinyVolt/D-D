Future Character, uses Artificer Maverick (CHA base) to represent a Tattoo artist with magical tattoos.

General Stat Spread: \
CHA >> CON â‰ˆ DEX (14) > INT = WIS = STR

Stat Spread if I can't use CHA base: \
INT(20) > CHA (16) > DEX (14) > CON (12) > STR = INT

Skills: Stealth, Animal Handling, Intimidation, Persuasion, Deception

Note: If possible, Elf (Mark of Shadow) would be better, giving me time to craft at night and a few new spells. We would lose one of our proficiencies (Probably Stealth), but that's probably fine. 

General Requirements: \
Level 1: \
Starting Feat: Strixhaven Initiate (Silverquill, Vicious Mockery, Thaumaturgy, Puppet or Dissonant Whispers) \
VHuman Feat: Shadow-Touched (+1 Casting Stat, Inflict Wounds, Invisiblity) \
Cantrips: Booming Blade / Shocking Grasp, Guidance 

Level 2: \
Infusion: Homunculus (Looks like Inkling, probably) \
Infusion: Spell Wrought Tattoo (Find Familiar) \
Infusion: Spell Wrought Tattoo (Arms of Hadar) \
Infusion: Spell Wrought Tattoo (Disguise Self) 

Level 3 Breakthrough: Druid, get Shillelagh and Entangle

Level 4 Feat: Strixhaven Mascot (Silverquill, Inkling Mascot, Very thematic) 

Level 5 Breakthrough: Paladin, for Find Steed, Wrathful Smite

Level 6: \
Infusion: Cloak of Elvenkind \
Infusion: Spell-Refueling Ring

Level 9 Breakthrough: Cleric (Bestow Curse / Spirit Guardians)

Wants: 
Big Request: \
Using an Eberron exclusive Race

Small Changes (imo) for Flavor: \
Can I play a Charisma based Artificer if I swear off multiclassing? It keeps to the more artistic sorcerer vibes I'm kinda hoping for with the character \
Can I reflavor Shillelagh as just a touch attack where my tattoos spread off my skin onto theirs, hurting them? I'll keep a hand free that would have been holding a staff. \
Can I change the damage type of Booming Blade to Necrotic Damage (Both rare damages, Necrotic is basically just worse. Instead of a boom, the target just screams)

Note: Ensnaring Strike and other Smites are affected by the Cantrip DC increase during the initial hit
