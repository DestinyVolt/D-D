Future Character, uses Artificer Maverick (CHA base) to represent a Tattoo artist with magical tattoos.

General Stat Spread:

Skills: Stealth, Animal Handling, Intimidation, Persuasion, Deception

General Requirements: \

Wants: 
Big Request: \
Can I use a background feature from Ravnica (Azorius Functionary)? I basically just want Ensnaring Strike. 

Small Changes (imo) for Flavor: \
Can I play a Charisma based Artificer if I swear off multiclassing? It keeps to the more artistic sorcerer vibes I'm kinda hoping for with the character \
Can I reflavor Shillelagh as just a touch attack where my tattoos spread off my skin onto theirs, hurting them? I'll keep a hand free that would have been holding a staff. \
Can I change the damage type of Booming Blade to Necrotic Damage (Both rare damages, Necrotic is basically just worse)

Note: Ensnaring Strike and other Smites are affected by the Cantrip DC increase during the initial hit
