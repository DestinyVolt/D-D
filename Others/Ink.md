Small Changes (imo) for Flavor: \
Can I play a Charisma based Artificer if I swear off multiclassing? It keeps to the more artistic sorcerer vibes I'm kinda hoping for with the character \
Can I change the damage type of Booming Blade to Necrotic Damage (Both rare damages, Necrotic is basically just worse. Instead of a boom, the target just screams)

Note: Ensnaring Strike and other Smites are affected by the Cantrip DC increase during the initial hit
