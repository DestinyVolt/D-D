Background: Archaeologist
Backstory: The civilization she first investigated was the remains of her own clan. Her egg was frozen during a Frost Giant attack and she hatched some 20 years later when the ice melted, long after the frost giants had left. She was raised by Kobolds, who found her egg. Being raised by Kobolds taught her the importance of the clan before everything else. When she learned her true nature, investigating the remains of her village, she left her Kobold clan, to find if there were any remains of her clan, and if she could get revenge on the giants. She funds her travels by diving into crypts, dungeons, and other archaeolical finds, especially those of a Giant heritage. From one crypt, she learned the Giant's rune magic, and she intends to make use of this to get revenge. 

She doesn't like bringing up that her clan is gone (Clans are central in dragonborn life, to the point that they lead with their clan name before their given name) so she just acts vague about it when asked and references them casually to put up an effort of them seeming alive.
