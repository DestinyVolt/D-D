## Soul of the Dragon Queen
Contained within your small form is the soul of the dead Dragon Queen, Tiamat. She is you, and slowly your power will grow. 
You may not attune to any magic items, and you would find the need to do so insulting.  

### Artifact
The Soul of the Dragon Queen grants the following properties: 
- 1 major beneficial property (You can't be Blinded, Deafened, Stunned, or Poisoned)
- 2 minor detrimental properties (Other creatures cannot take short or long rests while within 300ft of you, Animals within 30ft of you are Hostile towards you )
- 1 major detrimental property (Giants are always Hostile towards you.)

### Call Dragons
While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.

### Hunger of the Hoard
You crave gold, jewels, riches, magical objects. You can consume treasure, and as you absorb it, the Soul of the Dragon Queen grants further boons, based on the [worth of the treasure consumed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8XAiXpOfz9cMWt1RTBicmpmUDg/view?resourcekey=0-ceHUken0_UhQ3Apa6g4SJA). 
The Soul has five stages of power, starting with Dormant. Once an acceptable level of treasure has been consumed, it will become closer to fully awakening.  
Additionally, for every 10,000gp worth of treasure you consume, roll a d100. If it is less than your level, you gain an Ability Score Increase. 
If it is more than your current level but less than or equal to 20, you will gain an additional ASI at that level. If the result is 100, you can increase 1 stat of your choice by 4.
