| Adventure Name          | My Level | Intended Level | Completed | Challenge |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |:---:|-----|
| Prologue |  1st   | 4x 1st         | ☑ | Something is wrong with my village. Crops have failed, the livestock stands in the fields like stick figures, the rain has dwindled, and the river has receded. The village elders determined that I was the strongest of my hatchmates, and that I would go and search for a solution. They gave me a scroll written long ago by one of my ancestors, and told me to go to the place known as Candlekeep. Apparently, a mage who may be able to help us recides there. |
| The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces |  1st   | 4x 1st | ☑ | I arrived at Candlekeep. It is a truly remarkable structure. The men at the gate gladly accepted the document in exchange for entrance, apparently it was written by the legendary warrior who shares my name, which caused a little confusion. I didn't get to read it (the elders told me not to), but I wish I had. I was shown to the room by a cute tiefling scribe named Irony. They seemed confused as I did when we found the room that the mage was supposed to be staying in empty, with nothing but a book and a couple of personal items. However, I found a code word in the book that opened a portal to another location. They wished me luck as I moved into the portal. On the other side, I found the mage. He agreed to help the village in exchange for help mapping out the manor on the other side of the portal. I agreed, but when he stepped back through, I heard a shriek and the portal closed. I had to go through the mansion, and  Iwas attacked several times. Luckily, my training in self defense held strong, enough for me to find the alchemy room. I found and imbibed a potion that I thought was a health potion, but was something much stronger. It awakened something in me. *I can feel the power of Ravithra coursing through me.* I feel the need to *bite*. |
| Post-script 1 | 2nd | ☑ | 4x 1st | Once I escaped the extradimensional space, I found the mage dead on the floor... He was killed by the Imp he took with him. I talked to the Avowed, and they were deeply sorry that this happened. A head sage, Teles Ahvoste, also suggested that I not return to my people as I am right now, that my current frenzied state could be contagious. I can't help but agree, but I begged that they send someone to help with the curse. After much discussion, it was agreed that I would begin working at the Keep, studying what happened to me, and learning to control myself, in exchange for Teles going to save my clan. They have given me the book I originally came in with. Kau-Sscarzi was an accomplished warrior-mage, and it seems that she too may have been infected with Ravithra's Frenzy. I've been studying the book and my command over the earth has grown. She was also sent away from her clan on a mission when young, in order to save her people. Perhaps the Elders intended for this to happen? |
| Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions | 3rd | ☐ | 4x 2nd | Irony suggested that I look into Lycanthropy, suggesting that it might related to what's affecting me. They've been really helpful since I started working here (I think they might have a small crush). I found a book by some madman named Mazfroth that had some interesting essays on Lycanthropy, but before I could finish reading the book, it transformed into a horrible creature and attacked me! When I informed the Avowed of what happened, they explained that this was the 3rd such occurrence. I talked to two of people who had gifted these fakes, and they were able to point me towards a market in Baldur's Gate where they bought it. Teles agreed to let me leave, with the understanding that my people rarely travel, so it is unlikely I will run into another Nagaji so long as I don't return home. The gatewarden, Kalan Strongbranch, gave me a badge of Candlekeep, proof that I have been sent by them. In exchange for the magical book I found in the manor, he granted it a minor enchantment to make my weapon strikes more powerful. On my way to Balder's Gate, a Ratman attempted to Ambush me, leading a group of oversized rats. I believe he was a "were-rat," who was taking advantage of his lycanthropy. I was able to easily detect him, strangled the life from his body, and consumed his little pack. It was a good meal. If this is what lycanthropy is, I don't believe I have it. It was pathetic. It turned out that a group of weres were the ones hawking the fake books. I made it clear that I would be returning to Candlekeep with all the real books, and they refused, trying to use some ability to lull me to sleep, but they are no snake charmers. I tore through their ranks, leaving every one dead on the floor. I took the books and returned home. The Master Sage seemed somewhat troubled by my actions, but was happy to the see the books returned. I was given a Helm of Comprehending Languages as thanks for completing my task, which should make it easier to study what's causing my Frenzy. |
