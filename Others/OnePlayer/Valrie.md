### Adventures:
| Adventure Name          | My Level | Intended Level | Completed | Challenge |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |:---:|-----|
| Phandelver (Chapter 1) |  1st   | 4x 1th         | ☑ | Jesus Christ. Was bleeding out 3 times, but I managed to do it. Sildar is avenged. Owe the Priestess a favor.|
| Phandelver (Chapter 2) | 3rd | 4x 2nd | ☑ | I'm much more competent now. I can do this. I'm going to figure out what happened to that Dwarf who hired me. |
| Phandelver (Chapter 3) | 4th | 4x 3rd | ☑ | Almost died to Orcs. I got cocky. I wasn't expecting them to run so fast. I had to use all the scrolls I was saving... Almost back to Phandelan |
| Phandelver (Chapter 3.5) | 5th | 4x 3rd | ☑ | Cragmaw Castle cleared. Turns out the Goblins are working with the Drow. Typical. I rescued Gundren, and he's offered me a 10% share of the mine if I can figure out what happened to his Brothers and deal with this "Black Spider." It's likely a drow. I'm following the map he gave me. |
| Phandelver (Chapter 4) | 5th | 4x 4th | ☑ |  Nezznar is dead. He luckily kept me alive to torture me for information, and I was able to escape and kill him.|
| Phandelver (Chapter 4.5) | 6th | 4x 4th | ☑ | I managed to rescue one of Gundren's brothers, but the other was dead when I arrived. As a favor to them, I cleared out the rest of the mines. That Flameskull was annoying. |
| Phandelver (Chapter 5) | 7th | 4x 5th | ☐ | I'm going to head to Thundertree. One of the Villagers mentioned that the town had been overrun by undead, I figured I might clear them out. |
