### Future Progression
Genuinely consider whether it's worth going past this level of Ranger. Can't even use Swift Quiver with my arm, so what's the point of continuing. Rogue, Cleric, and Fighter might be better progression. Champion Fighter 3 might be worth it. 

Consider: \
War Cleric 1 / Champion 3 / Rogue 1/2/3/5


### Adventures:
| Adventure Name          | My Level | Intended Level | Completed | Challenge |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |:---:|-----|
| Phandelver (Chapter 1) |  1st   | 4x 1th         | ☑ | Jesus Christ. Was bleeding out 3 times, but I managed to do it. Sildar is avenged. Owe the Priestess a favor.|
| Phandelver (Chapter 2) | 3rd | 4x 2nd | ☑ | I'm much more competent now. I can do this. I'm going to figure out what happened to that Dwarf who hired me. |
| Phandelver (Chapter 3) | 4th | 4x 3rd | ☑ | Almost died to Orcs. I got cocky. I wasn't expecting them to run so fast. I had to use all the scrolls I was saving... Almost back to Phandelan |
| Phandelver (Chapter 3.5) | 5th | 4x 3rd | ☑ | Cragmaw Castle cleared. Turns out the Goblins are working with the Drow. Typical. I rescued Gundren, and he's offered me a 10% share of the mine if I can figure out what happened to his Brothers and deal with this "Black Spider." It's likely a drow. I'm following the map he gave me. |
| Phandelver (Chapter 4) | 5th | 4x 4th | ☑ |  Nezznar is dead. He luckily kept me alive to torture me for information, and I was able to escape and kill him.|
| Phandelver (Chapter 4.5) | 6th | 4x 4th | ☑ | I managed to rescue one of Gundren's brothers, but the other was dead when I arrived. As a favor to them, I cleared out the rest of the mines. That Flameskull was annoying. |
| Phandelver (Chapter 5) | 7th | 4x 5th | ☑ | I'm going to head to Thundertree. One of the Villagers mentioned that the town had been overrun by undead, I figured I might clear them out. |
| Wages of Vice | 7th | 4x 5th | ☑ | I have found a place known as the Radient Citadel. It is connected to many worlds, I may be able to find my way home from here... |
| Sins of Our Elders | 8th | 4x 6th | ☑ | I put to rest the spirit of that poor Magistrate. I hope she is peaceful, whereever she went. |
| Gold for Fools and Princes | 8th | 4x 7th | ☑ | Stupid Traitorous Prince. Both princes were in way over their heads, but at least Simbon realized it. I leave with a ring as a gift, and an invitation to return whenever I desire. I let him keep Dragonsguard. Reminder for him to be steadfast. For now, I must continue my travels. |
| Book of Cylinders | 9th | 4x 6th | ☑ | Simbon reccomended by services to someone at a Library known as the Candlekeep. It was a pretty easy job helping some Frogfolk out, and got a nice set of armor from it. |
| Trail of Distruction | 9th | 4x 8th | ☑ | Some twink tiefling almost got me killed saving him from some Salamanders, and I had to fight a massive elemental. |
| ??? | 11th | 4x 9th | ☐ | Reminder to go shopping |
