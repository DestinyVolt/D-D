### Adventures:
| Adventure Name           | My Level | Intended Level | Completed | Notes |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Lost Mine (Part 1 + Town)| 3rd      | 4x 1st/2nd     | ☑ | I'm definitely more powerful, but I'm still physically weak... Those little bug people better deliver >:(|
| Lost Mine (Chapter 2)    | 4th      | 4x 2nd         | ☑ | Towns are so rich, and yet we were so poor. God, our clan really was pathetic. I deserve better. |
| Lost Mine (Cragmaw)      | 4th      | 4x 3rd         | ☑ | I'm the queen of Cragmaw now! I sit on my throne surrounded by gold, but I want more... I deserve more. |
| Lost Mine (Echo Mines)   | 5th      | 4x 4th         | ☑ | Easy Peasy. I gained a new bugbear follower and I've got a lair now. This will be my castle until a more appropriate one is found. My people found a set of gauntlets underneath the ground, but they are too big for me to wear. I've given them to the pixie bugs so they can hopefully make some progress... or else, it's shatter time >:) |
| Lost Mine (Thundertree)  | 6th      | 4x "3rd"       | ☐ | I guess I should go to that place that one family told me about. |
