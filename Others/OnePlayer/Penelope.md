### Adventures:
| Adventure Name          | My Level | Intended Level | Completed | Challenge |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |:---:|-----|
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1) |  1st   | 4x 1th         | ☑ | I'm so excited for my first day at Strixhaven! There was a mimic attack, but I met a really cool older student named Urzmaktok, and I joined a club! |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.1) |  2nd   | 4x 1th         | ☑ | I managed to get a job thanks to Urz (He doesn't like when I call him that ;p) and I won a frog race, but then the frogs got really big and attacked and I had to fight them off and they turned normal.  |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.3) |  3rd   | 4x 2th         | ☑ | I passed my first exam. School has been going really well and I've made another friend, after I won a game of Wizard Gizzard and was attacked by a bunch of Steam Mephits, but I managed to take them out while the other students dealt with a bug infestation. |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.4) |  3rd   | 4x 2th         | ☑ | I've been doing well on my exams! Quin, that butt, tried to embarress me by sending me to find some rude doll in a campus mansion, but I actually managed to find it. Made him eat his words :D |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.5) |  3th   | 4x 3rd         | ☑ | I helped a professor figure out what's been going on this year with all the attacks! I managed to purify the source of the problem. In return, she got me this awesome Alchemy Kit! |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 2) | 5th | 4x 4th | ☑ | Time for my second year! I'm now officially a student of Witherbloom! On top of that, Jav convinced me to join up with him for the Mage Tower competition, and I convinced Urz to join us :D |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 2.1) | 5th | 4x 4th | ☑ | I helped professor Sharpbeak by tagging some mascots but more importantly URZ AND I ARE DATING NOW!!!! (First Exam went well btw) |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 2.2) | 6th | 4x 5th | ☑ | More strange things are going on. A bunch of cuties (Pests) conglomerated into a horrible monster, and a Slaad attacked us while we were planning for the big game. Despite everything, I'm still doing well on my exams. |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 2.3) | 6th | 4x 5th | ☑ | Things keep attacking me (This time, a summoned galeb duhr). While I was doing a favor for Prof. Blackstone, I was attacked once again, but I discovered what has likely been causing all of this to happen; Mage Hunters.  |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 2.4) | 7th | 4x 5th | ☑ | The mage hunters finally attacked, right after I won the Battle of Strixhaven. I had to run and get a teacher to save me, their abilities were too much for me. Thank goodness for Gub, or I would have died.  |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 3) | 8th | 4x 6th | ☑ | Back for another year of school! I'm so excited for the Big dance this year; The Magister's Masquerade! I get to wear a pretty dress and Urz is gonna take me and it's gonna be wonderful |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 3.1) | 8th | 4x 6th | ☑ | Quintilius is just the WORST! He challenge me to a duel, apparently he's so mad that I'm "oh so special." I didn't ask to be attacked last year! He even threated to sabotage some of Utz's experiments if I didn't come. So I went and beat him, and for some reason he passed out, but then his friend Rubina tried to do a spell and there was a wild mage surge and a Giant appeared and attacked me. UGH. Anyway, I did well on my exam, and the professor for the class (Dean Augusta Tullus) seems nice enough. |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 3.2) | 8th | 4x 6th | ☑ | I've begun studying and designing my outfit for the Masquerade!!! I'm going to base my outfit on the famous adventurer Xerastra Ephemzel, the Astral Elf who helped so many people, and sacrified so much, on her way to get home. To think, she did so much after losing an arm soon after being stranded all alone in the Material Plane. She's an inspiration. The Dean says I'll get extra credit for it, so I've been doing a ton of research. While I was researching, I noticed a weird block of time about 200 years ago where there weren't any records? Apparently a bunch of students died that year. Scary stuff. I spent like, 3 days straight working on my outfit for the fashion show, I'm exhausted ;-;. But it's finally done. It's beautiful (Check Total: 30)! | 
| Strixhaven (Chapter 3.3) | 8th | 4x 6th | ☑ | I may have... worked a bit to hard on my outfit, I'm exhausted... BUt I have to walk the dress for the fashion show, so Utz is giving me (hehehe I pestered himm) a smalll magical energy patch that should keep me awake until after the show, but he warned me I'll probably crash afterwards, it's fine- Update: I fell unconcious, but my outfit auctioned for 1500gp!!! |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 3.4) | 8th | 4x 6th | ☑ | Me and 9 other students were asked to go gather some things in the witherbloom swamps. Besides a couple alligators, it was pretty uneventful. I also helped move some stuff out of the Biblioplex, which was pretty boring, but I snuck away for a moment to do some research. Apparently, 200 years ago, various students were effected by a sickness. That's what caused all those people to die. Given how some people are describing being sick, I'm a little worried. Anyway, my exam went well, but the Dean missed it. Rumor is, she's missing a lot of classes, and seems to have been struck with some Malady. gosh, I hope she's going to be okay. I know it's probably nothing, but given what I read in the records, I'm feeling skitish. |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 3.5) | 9th | 4x 6th | ☑ | I did dance lessons with Urz today! He was saying that it was silly, but I could tell he was just nervous; it was really cute. Anyway, a group of us were setting up for the dance today and it was just a complete mess. A box fell on my head, Javenesh felt sick and had to leave, I noticed something wrong with one of the firework setups, and then a couple hours later, Jav and everyone else feeling sick suddenly went crazy and started fight everyone and try to escape. I ended up calming them down, but gosh that was scary. I did some investigating after what happened, and met with the Dean to ask what was going on, but she acted really weird. I'm getting really worried. You know... She's still go that weird orb... (Finals went well, but the Dean was absent again.) |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 3.6) | 10th | 4x 7th | ☑ | Oh my gosh it's the day of the event and one of Urzy's experiments got lose and he has to fix it and now he can't come oh this is the WORST EVER. Honestly I might sneak out and go figure out what's going on with the dean while this is going oh. If Urz can't be there, what's the point? - It was alright. Not having my boyfriend there seriously put a damper on things. A lot of people complemented my dress though! The Dean was acting weird, and when she left, I followed. Three Lorehold students seemed to be affected by the visions, but I quickly knocked them unconcious. Something is very wrong. I disguised myself as the Dean and made my way to the Deans' Repository. She was clearly possessed and attacked me! I managed to knock her unconcious, but then the orb summoned some creep named Murgaxor. He said he was the most powerful strixhaven wizard ever, and that he'd have his revenge. I ended up destroying the orb. The Dean covered for me after the fact, thank goodness. I leanred from the dean that apparently he was a student long ago who was expelled and defeated for sucking the life force of his fellow students. I'm worried he might target me in the future, but for now, I'm safe. I'm going to go home. I'll rest, and then maybe train, just in case. |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 4) | 12th | 4x 8th | ☑ | I'm scared. They've confirmed that Murgaxor is lurking around campus, and I feel like he might target me... It's making it hard to focus, I did worse on my most recent exam than I ever have before. Professor Lang requested that I help them investigate. I'm scared to, but I know I'm the only one prepared enough to take stuff on besides the teachers. I investigated the detention bogs with Professor Minexes. Murgaxor is definetly present, but I can't figure out what he's up to. I'm close to making a breakthrough in my spellwork, I should have it done by the end of tonight. |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 4.1) | 14th | 4x 9th | ☑ | It's bad. Murgaxor has somehow shielded himself from any magic that the faculty cast. So, I guess it's up to me? He's managed to spread his curse throughout the school, and whatever sacrificial magic he plans to cast could hurt everyone. Apparently the abjuration magic is keyed to the teachers, so I should be able to bypass it. And so, the teachers have basically told me I can forget about classes, since I've clearly proven myself already, and said that I'll get full marks so long as I make an attempt to stop Murgaxor. I head out for the Fortress Badlands tomorrow morning... |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 4.2) | 14th | 4x 9th | ☐ | I cleared out Murgaxor's hideout, but he's not there. I was almost killed by a Bloodmage in a mask, but I killed her. I killed a living person. I don't feel good, but I have to keep moving forward. I found some documents suggesting that he plans on completing his awful ritual at the Ruins of Caerdoon, in about a weeks time. I'm going to head back to Strixhaven, report on what I've found, rest, and prepare. Urz came back to wish me off... I love him so much. He's helping me prepare some final magic for the event, and managed to cure Froug's petrification. I was able to reverse engineer the petrification process to make another Homunculus (I named it Toab). I asked Urz if he knew where I could find a ring to enchant, and he said yes and ran off. When he got back, he got on his knees, and proposed!!!!! He said he wanted to ask before I left to go "save the world." I said yes, of course. We'll figure out arrangements after all this is over. Mel and Jav put together a little fete for me at the Tavern, it was nice to talk to everyone before I left. But, I have to leave. It's time to go. |
