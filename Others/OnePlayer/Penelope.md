### Adventures:
| Adventure Name          | My Level | Intended Level | Completed | Challenge |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |:---:|-----|
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1) |  1st   | 4x 1th         | ☑ | I'm so excited for my first day at Strixhaven! There was a mimic attack, but I met a really cool older student named Urzmaktok, and I joined a club! |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.1) |  2nd   | 4x 1th         | ☑ | I managed to get a job thanks to Urz (He doesn't like when I call him that ;p) and I won a frog race, but then the frogs got really big and attacked and I had to fight them off and they turned normal.  |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.3) |  3rd   | 4x 2th         | ☑ | I passed my first exam. School has been going really well and I've made another friend, after I won a game of Wizard Gizzard and was attacked by a bunch of Steam Mephits, but I managed to take them out while the other students dealt with a bug infestation. |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.4) |  3rd   | 4x 2th         | ☑ | I've been doing well on my exams! Quin, that butt, tried to embarress me by sending me to find some rude doll in a campus mansion, but I actually managed to find it. Made him eat his words :D |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.5) |  3th   | 4x 3rd         | ☑ | I helped a professor figure out what's been going on this year with all the attacks! I managed to purify the source of the problem. In return, she got me this awesome Alchemy Kit! |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 2) | 5th | 4x 4th | ☐ | Time for my second year! I'm now officially a student of Witherbloom! On top of that, Jav convinced me to join up with him for the Mage Tower competition, and I convinced Urz to join us :D |
