### Adventures:
| Adventure Name          | My Level | Intended Level | Completed | Challenge |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |:---:|-----|
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1) |  1st   | 4x 1th         | ☐ | I'm so excited for my first day at Strixhaven! There was a mimic attack, but I met a really cool older student named Urzmaktok, and I joined a club! |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.1) |  2nd   | 4x 1th         | ☐ | I managed to get a job thanks to Urz (He doesn't like when I call him that ;p) and I won a frog race, but then the frogs got really big and attacked and I had to fight them off and they turned normal.  |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.3) |  3rd   | 4x 2th         | ☐ | I passed my first exam. School has been going really well and I've made another friend, after I won a game of Wizard Gizzard and was attacked by a bunch of Steam Mephits, but I managed to take them out while the other students dealt with a bug infestation. |
| Strixhaven (Chapter 1.4) |  3rd   | 4x 2th         | ☐ | I've been doing well on my exams! Quin, that butt, tried to embarress me by sending me to find some rude doll in a campus mansion, but I actually managed to find it. Made him eat his words :D |
