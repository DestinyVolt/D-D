| Tomb of the Grave Knight | 6th | 4x 5th | ☑ | Easy. I'm much stronger now. |
| A Deadly Disturbance | 7th | 4x 5th | ☑ | Easy. Wizards are always overconfident. |

| The Chromatic Collective | 18th | 4x ??th | ☐ | The silver dragon was concerned by a meeting of chromatics. Apparently Icefang was part of a larger cromatic alliance. It's time to force them to bend the knee... |
