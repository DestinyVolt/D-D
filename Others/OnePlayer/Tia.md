| Curse of the Blood Moon  | 3rd      | 4x 2st         | ☑ | Got heavily carried by Channel Divinity and the Druid who was helping. |
| Frozen Temple of the Ice Priest | 4th | 4x 3rd       | ☑ | Managed to get through it, but things got dicey with the final Ice Priest |
| Forsaken Labyrinth of the Golden Baron | 4th | 4x 3rd | ☑ | Almost got killed by a Basilisk. Lord. But I'm finally a decent level.  |
| Tomb of the Grave Knight | 6th | 4x 5th | ☑ | Easy. I'm much stronger now. |
| A Deadly Disturbance | 7th | 4x 5th | ☑ | Easy. Wizards are always overconfident. |
| Tomb of Tzentak | 8th | 4x 7th | ☑ | So much gold... Almost died, but soo worth it. Thank goodness for Death Ward. |
| The Halls of Havareem | 10th | 4x 9th | ☑ | A capable wizard, but no match for me. His traps couldn't hurt me. |
| There be Dragons | 10th | 4x 10th | ☑ | A strong foe, but a stupid one. It is a shame my former breathen do not follow me as they should. I am much more powerful now. |
| You'll never take me alive, Coppers! | 12th | 4x ??th | ☑ | Copper Dragons thought they could best me, but they are slain and their hoard is mine. I intend to find more foolish metalics like them. |
| Offerings to ~~Bahamut~~ Tiamat  | 14th | 4x ??th | ☐ | There's apparently a small town in the mountains that hosts a large festival to Bahamut. It's a 2 week trek, but I'm very happy to crash the party and take the offerings for myself. Supposedly some Silver Dragons like to show up to mingle among the crowd. Hopefully I'll be able to track them back to their hoards. |
