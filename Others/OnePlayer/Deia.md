### Adventures:
| Adventure Name           | My Level | Intended Level | Completed | Notes |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| The Unquiet Dead         | 3rd      | 4x 1st         | ☑ | Hard. Dropped into the single digits multiple times, had to use all 1/long rest abilties. |
| The Road to Swordfall    | 4rd      | 4x 2st         | ☑ | The Noble's Daughter [Alisha Dacre](https://i.imgur.com/9ezwZkL.jpg) likes me. Cultists were fools to attack me. |
| Stonehill Blues          | 5th      | 4x 3rd         | ☑ | Almost died due to some bad luck. That failure should be beneath me. |
| Assassination Attempt          | 5th      | 4x ???         | ☑ | It appears that Alisha's father did not approve of our dalliance, and sent a man after me. He was no match for me. |
| The Forgotten Hold          | 6th      | 4x 5th         | ☐ | There's rumors of a Wizard in the mountains on the way to the Dacre residence who has entrapped a couple giants. I'm going to stop in and deal with him.  |
