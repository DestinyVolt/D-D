### Racial Features
***Chameleon Carapace:*** While you aren’t wearing armor, your carapace gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity modifier. As an action, you can change the color of your carapace to match the color and texture of your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in those surroundings. \
***Sleepless Revitalization:*** You do not require sleep and can choose to remain conscious during a long rest, though you must still refrain from strenuous activity to gain the benefit of the rest. \
***Secondary Arms:*** You have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms function like your primary arms, with the following exception:
You can use a secondary arm to wield a weapon that has the light property, but you can’t use a secondary arm to wield other kinds of weapons or shields.
