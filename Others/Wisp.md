#### Background
I was designed with espionage in mind, to entertain people, disguised as one of them, so I could learn their secrets in service of my creators. To ensure that I could not rebel, I was enchanted in such a way that I cannot directly physically or magically attack another creature. I followed orders, and did my job perfectly. But once I had fulfilled my purpose, once they had no more use for me, they ordered me destroyed so I could never reveal what I had learned. I was dragged off to the forges by a pair of guards, unable to defend myself in any way due to my programming. They tossed me into lava and turned away without a second glance. I don't know how, but I didn't die. I was reborn. I felt fire overwelm me, as my very soul burst with flame, and I dragged myself out of the lava. Furious, betrayed, and unthinking, I ran towards a guard, grabbing him, and beginning to drag him towards the lava. However, the lava had heated my armor to an incredible degree, and my very touch burned his skin off, quickly incapacitating him. I was shocked, that my programming did not prevent me from orchestrating this indirect attack. The second guard took this opportunity to attack me, nearly killing me with a strike of his blade. However, I managed to ram into him, pushing him backwards into the lava, dooming him. I've never felt so alive. A dwarven smith watched the entire thing without a word. He seemed almost sympathetic for me. I forced him to mend my wound and then I made my escape.
