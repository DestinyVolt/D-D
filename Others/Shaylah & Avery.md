#### Racial Abilities 
**Fairy Flight:** You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. This flight is magical and does not require the use of your wings (if you have them).  
**Fairy Magic:** You know the Druidcraft and Faerie Fire spells. You can cast Faerie Fire without expending a spell slot once per long rest. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.
**Fey Passage:** You can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide.

#### Pact Abilities 
**Pact of the Chain:** You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual, and can choose to summon Avery with it. You can use your Action to order Avery to make an attack as a reaction.  
**Genieâ€™s Wrath:** Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra bludgeoning damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus.  
**Investment of the Chain Master:** As a bonus action, you can order Avery to make an attack as her Action. Additionally, she can use your spell save DC when forcing saving throws.  
**Voice of the Chain Master:** You can communicate telepathically with Avery and perceive through Avery's senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through Avery's senses, you can also speak through her in your own voice.  

<details><summary>Future Abilities</summary>
<p>
  **Shadow Touched (+1 CHA):** You learn the spells Inflict Wounds and Invisibility, and can use your Action to cast them through Avery using her reaction without expending a spell slot once per long rest. 
  **Agonizing Blast:** You can add your Charisma Modifier to the damage done from each bolt of Eldritch Blast.  
  Consider Poisoner feat? Preferably for the familiar? Would combine well with Creation and Magic Stone. Alternatively, Inspiring Leader to give Avery extra hit points.
