### Mantle of Flame
As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
- Any creature takes 5 fire damage if it hits you with a melee attack from within 5 feet of you or if it touches you.
- Whenever you roll fire damage on your turn, the roll gains a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.
- You have a flying speed of 40 feet and can hover.
- You have resistance to all damage.

### Flames of Phlegethos
Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you gain the following benefits until the end of your next turn:
- You regain hit points equal to the slot’s level + 5.
- You ignore resistance to Fire damage.
- You can reroll all 1s on fire damage rolls, once per spell. If there remain 1s after rolling, you can treat them as 2s.
- Any creature takes 1d4 fire damage if it hits you with a melee attack from within 5 feet of you or if it touches you.

### Pheonix Spark
The fiery energy within you grows restless and vengeful. In the face of defeat, it surges outward to preserve you in a fiery roar. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to draw on the spark of the phoenix. You are instead reduced to 1 hit point, and each creature within 10 feet of you takes 15 fire damage.

If you use this feature while under the effects of your Mantle of Flame, this feature instead deals 50 fire damage, and your Mantle of Flame immediately ends.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
